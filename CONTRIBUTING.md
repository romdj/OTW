# Contributing to otw.sport

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **otw** - The IMDb of Sporting Events! This guide outlines our development workflow, branching strategy, and contribution standards.

## 📋 Quick Start

1. **Fork and clone** the repository
2. **Create a feature branch** from `main`
3. **Use conventional commits** for all changes
4. **Run local validation** before pushing
5. **Create a Pull Request** to `main`

## 🌳 Branching Strategy

We use a **Feature Branch Workflow** with optional **Release Branches** for controlled deployments.

### Branch Types

| Branch Type | Purpose | Naming Convention | Example |
|-------------|---------|-------------------|---------|
| `main` | Production-ready code | `main` | `main` |
| Feature | New features or enhancements | `feat/description` | `feat/event-rating-system` |
| Bugfix | Bug fixes | `fix/description` | `fix/search-filters` |
| Hotfix | Critical production fixes | `hotfix/description` | `hotfix/security-patch` |
| Release | Release preparation | `release/vX.X.X` | `release/v0.3.0` |

### Development Workflow

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[feature/new-feature] --> B[main]
    B --> C[release/v0.3.0]
    C --> D[v0.3.0 tag]
    D --> E[Production]
    
    F[hotfix/critical-fix] --> B
    F --> C
```

## 🚀 Development Process

### 1. Creating a Feature Branch

```bash
# Start from latest main
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create and switch to feature branch
git checkout -b feat/event-discovery-feature
```

### 2. Development with Conventional Commits

Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format:

```bash
# Features (minor version bump)
git commit -m "feat: add event rating and tagging system"
git commit -m "feat(ui): implement event discovery filters"

# Bug fixes (patch version bump)
git commit -m "fix: resolve event search pagination issue"
git commit -m "fix(api): handle missing event metadata gracefully"

# Breaking changes (major version bump)
git commit -m "feat!: redesign event schema for v2"
# or
git commit -m "feat: redesign event API endpoints

BREAKING CHANGE: All endpoints now require authentication headers"

# Other types
git commit -m "docs: update event rating API documentation"
git commit -m "test: add integration tests for event service"
git commit -m "chore: update dependencies to latest versions"
git commit -m "style: fix linting issues in components"
git commit -m "refactor: extract event logic into services"
```

### 3. Local Validation

Before pushing, run our validation suite:

```bash
# Quick validation (runs automatically on commit)
npm run lint
npm run check
npm test

# Full validation (runs automatically on push)
npm run release:prepare
```

### 4. Creating Pull Requests

```bash
# Push feature branch
git push origin feat/event-discovery-feature

# Create PR through GitHub UI or CLI
gh pr create --title "feat: add event discovery feature" --body "Description of changes"
```

**PR Requirements:**
- ✅ All CI checks must pass
- ✅ Code review approval required
- ✅ Conventional commit format
- ✅ Tests included for new features
- ✅ Documentation updated if needed

### 5. Merging Strategy

**Use "Squash and Merge"** to maintain clean history:
- Squashes all feature commits into one
- Ensures conventional commit format in main branch
- Enables proper semantic-release versioning

## 📦 Release Strategy

We support two release approaches:

### Option A: Continuous Releases (Default)

Every merge to `main` can trigger an automatic release via semantic-release:

```bash
feat/event-ratings → main → automatic v0.3.0 release
```

### Option B: Controlled Releases with Release Branches

Accumulate features on `main`, then create release branches for controlled deployment:

```bash
# Accumulate features on main
feat/event-ratings → main
feat/ui-improvements → main
feat/event-discovery → main

# Create release branch when ready
git checkout main
git checkout -b release/v0.3.0

# Finalize release
npm run release:prepare
npm run semantic-release

# Merge back to main
git checkout main
git merge release/v0.3.0
```

- **Error boundaries** - handle errors gracefully

## 🔒 Security Guidelines

- **Never commit secrets** or API keys
- **Audit dependencies** regularly (`npm audit`)
- **Review security alerts** in GitHub
- **Follow OWASP guidelines** for web security
