# 🏆 OTW.sport Multi-Sport Integration Roadmap

**The IMDb of Sporting Events** - A comprehensive platform for discovering, rating, and sharing unmissable sporting moments across all sports and competitions worldwide.

## 🎯 Vision & Mission

OTW.sport aims to become the definitive destination for sports fans to discover which events are worth watching based on emotional impact, historical significance, and community recommendations. Rather than just providing scores and statistics, we focus on the **intangibles that make sporting events memorable**: drama, tension, skill, and passion.

### Key Platform Features
- **Event Discovery**: Find historic games, thrilling finishes, and legendary performances
- **Emotional Tagging**: Rate events with descriptors like "nail-biter", "upset", "comeback"
- **Community Curation**: Create and share lists of must-watch sporting moments
- **Cross-Sport Recommendations**: Discover great events outside your favorite sports
- **Historical Context**: Understand the significance and story behind each event

│   │   └── international-leagues/     # Cross-border club competitions
│   ├── national-teams/               # International competitions between countries
│   └── individual/                   # Individual competitions (tennis, golf, etc.)
```

Each sport implementation includes:
- **Data Sources**: APIs, feeds, and official data providers
